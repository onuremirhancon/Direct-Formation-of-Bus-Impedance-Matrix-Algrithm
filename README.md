# Direct-Formation-of-Bus-Impedance-Matrix-Algrithm

This project was done within the scope of EE471 Power System Analysis I Course in the Department of Electrical Electronics Engineering of the Middle East Techincal University.

The aim of the project is the reading the bus data from a txt file in the format of IEEE CDF and construct Bus Admittance Matrix without constructing the bus admittance matrix.

The code is written in the MATLAB. Code is explained in the comment lines.
