# Direct-Formation-of-Bus-Impedance-Matrix-Algrithm

This project was done within the scope of EE471 Power System Analysis I Course in the Department of Electrical Electronics Engineering of the Middle East Techincal University.

The aim of the project is the reading the bus data from a txt file in the format of IEEE CDF and construct Bus Admittance Matrix without constructing the bus admittance matrix.

The code is written in the MATLAB. Code is explained in the comment lines. The code can be tested with ieee118buscdf file given in the repository. Moreover, detailed explanation of ieeecdf file format is given in the cdf_readme.txt file
